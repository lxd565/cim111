    <h2>For your mouth-watering cravings</h2>
    <p> SUGAR! was created fresh out of the oven to fufill your sweet needs. A year ago, Lexi brought her to-die-for chocolate chip cookies in for a bake sale. From that day on, people were hooked. With all this new demand for her baked goods, she decided to open the oven to the public.  </p>
